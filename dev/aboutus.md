# About Jo & Roxy

I'm Jo, the son of Elaine and Jason and have been around Triumphs all my life.
I have "*driven*" Triumphs since I could sit on my parents lap and reach the steering wheel, but I first drove a Spitfire on the road in 2015.

I'm Roxy and whilst I didn't grow up around Triumphs, they have been a key part of Jo and I's relationship. When he took me to my first IOW TSSC weekend in 2013, I absolutely loved it! Since then I have enjoyed every adventure we have had in our Spitfire, including our road trip to Le Mans classic in 2018.

Last year you would have seen us on the cover of The Courier for our wedding.

We have had a busy 2023 but are looking forward to continuing the mantle of the Isle of Wight Triumph Sport Six Club area.
